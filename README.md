# fCalc
Command Line Fractional calculator using Swift

**How it works?**

* The command-line program will repeatedly prompt the user for input and display the result until user types "exit".
* Legal operators shall be *,  /,  +,  - (multiply, divide, add, subtract).
* Operands and operators shall be separated by one or more spaces.
* Mixed numbers will be represented by whole&numerator/denominator; for example, "3&1/4", “-1&7/8”.
* Improper fractions, whole numbers, and negative numbers are allowed as operands. 

Example runs (where '?' represents the command prompt): ? 1/2 * 3&3/4 = 1&7/8 

? 2&3/8 + 9/8 = 3&1/2

? 1&3/4 - 2
= -1/4
